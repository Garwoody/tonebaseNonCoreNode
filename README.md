## How to edit the landing page copy
1. Clone this repository through CMD or by DOWNLOAD ZIP from the 'Clone or Download' box
1. Once cloned, navigate to /dynamicContent/landingPage.json
1. Edit the json file (it's pretty straightforward)
1. Make sure you have node.js installed. Run the command 'npm i' and the dependencies will be loaded
1. run 'node app' in command promt
1. Open your browser to localhost:8080 to see the changes
1. When you are done making changes, send me the JSON file you've made and I'll make it live (avoids confusion and I don't want to deal with branches.)
